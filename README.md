[S]UNY [O]swego [A]RG [P]ackage, or SOAP, is an alternate reality game (ARG) engine. Built on the open source platforms WordPress and BuddyPress, it is a bundle of pre-existing plugins and custom modifications that allow anyone who can install and host WordPress to run "what if" simulations and collaborative storytelling exercises.

SOAP is free software, released under the GPL v.2.0 license.

####Main Features

+ Ability to maintain up to three contiguous "scenarios" or story lines, each with as many "acts" or story developments as needed.
+ Front page visual menu that organizes the content for each scenario and its corresponding acts and comments in one place.
+ Track performance across 5 different goals: Participate, Invite, Attend, Educate and Act. Unlocking each goal is signaled by a golden star that is part of a user's public profile, so participants can see each other's progress and compete with one another.
- Ability for participants and instructors to track and monitor goal achievement in more detail through a progress report.
- Ability to schedule events and track attendance by entering user IDs, names, or emails individually or in bulk (one way to collect data is with the iMag PRO scanner and Uniscan iOS app).
- All the functionality, flexibility and stability of WordPress.
- All the social networking features of BuddyPress.
- Ability to post blog posts or announcements outside of the scenarios.
- View newest, active and popular members.
- Easily embed images, audio, and video.
- Generate polls and quizzes.
- ARGs can be private or public, and registrations can be restricted through blacklisting and whitelisting email domains.
... and much more!
