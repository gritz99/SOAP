New User Approve is a Wordpress plugin that allows a blog administrator to 
approve a user before they are able to access and login to the blog.

== Description ==

In a normal Wordpress blog, once a new user registers, the user is created in 
the database. Then an email is sent to the new user with their login 
credentials. Very simple. As it should be.

The New User Approve plugin modifies the registration process. When a user 
registers for the blog, the user gets created and then an email gets sent to 
the administrators of the site. An administrator then is expected to either 
approve or deny the registration request. An email is then sent to the user 
indicating whether they were approved or denied. If the user was approved, 
the email will include the login credentials. Until a user is approved, the 
user will not be able to login to the site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload new-user-approve to the wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. No configuration necessary.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why am I not getting the emails when a new user registers? =

The New User Approve plugin uses the functions provided by WordPress to send
email. Make sure your host is setup correctly to send email if this happens.

= How do I customize the email address and/or name when sending notifications to users? =

This is not a function of the plugin but of WordPress. WordPress provides the
*wp_mail_from* and *wp_mail_from_name* filters to allow you to customize this.
There are also a number of plugins that provide a setting to change this to 
your liking.

* [wp mail from](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-mailfrom/)
* [Mail From](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mail-from/)

= Why is the password reset when approving a user? =

The password is generated again because, by default, the user will not be aware
of their password. By generating a new password, the email that notifies the
user can also give them the new password just like the email does when recieving
your password on a regular WordPress install. At approval time, it is impossible
to retrieve the user's password.

There is a filter available (new_user_approve_bypass_password_reset) to turn off
this feature.
